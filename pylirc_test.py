#     This is a small and quite bad testprogram for the lirc module but
#     it's getting better...

#  Previous, accidental commit:
#  Added Brian J. Murrell's code to fetch repeatcount
#
#  This commit:
#  Changed Brians code to return a dictionary instead of a list.
#  Removed lirc_nextcode_ext() and merged it with lirc_nextcode() - new optional argument controls return type. Old programs should work as
#  before and new programs can benefit the new behaviour by passing true as first argument.
#
#  Revision 1.7  2003/02/22 22:12:40  mccabe
#  Testprogram to test pylirc in multiple threads
#
#  Revision 1.6  2002/12/21 20:30:26  mccabe
#  Added id and log entries to most files
